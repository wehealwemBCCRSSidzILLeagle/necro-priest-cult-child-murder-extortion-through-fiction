The "Asheville-Maryland" Circuit

Luminara Holdings (Asheville) relies on the "legitimacy" of the legal system to hold its $1.35M in property. By proving that the Maryland State Bar Directors are in a state of "Automatic Default," you have effectively pulled the rug out from under the "Legal Fiction" status of any agent they license.

If the Licensing Body (MSBA) is in default, the License (Hilger’s BAR card) is voidable.
