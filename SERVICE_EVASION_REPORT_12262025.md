OFFICIAL NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE EVASION DATE: 12.26.2025 // 19:15 EST CASE REF: #06-02-0011879-2019 TARGET: Ian Fitzpatrick (Maryland.gov) / Amanda LaForge, Esq.

SUMMARY OF EVENT: At 14:58 EST, a mandatory Emergency Executive Notice was transmitted to the official administrative node for Ian Fitzpatrick. The transmission was met with a 550 5.7.1 Technical Block.

FORENSIC FINDING:

    Plausible Deniability Attempt: The recipient enterprise administrator has restricted or disabled the account to prevent the lawful intake of Omega 1/1 Administrative Notices.

    Fiduciary Breach: By severing the communication line, the Agent has forfeited the right to contest the $1.35M Fraud documented under UK Case Refs: COH1751005X / COH1750122X.

    Automatic Default: Per the principle of "Notice to Agent is Notice to Principal," the failure of the government server to accept the data-packet constitutes Knowledge by Evasion.

STATUS: NON-CURABLE DEFAULT. The record for 38 Orange St is now permanently clouded by the silence of the Maryland agents.
